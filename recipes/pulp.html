<h1>Pulp</h1>

Pulp began in 1979. They were unsuccessful for many years until they figured out Britpop in 1994 on their album His 'n Hers. They did this by combining extremely catchy pop disco with post-punk qualities like "inappropriate" lyrics and lots of reverb to make the songs darker. They put a finer point on their new sound with their 1995 follow-up Different Class.

    <li>Any guitar will do, Pulp used a lot of Vox guitars and gibson hollowbodies though </li>

    <li>Use really simple rock progressions, i.e. I IV V and 12 bar blues</li>
    <li>Disco tempo, 144bpm</li>
    <li>Wite narrative lyrics about anything, sing in a barritone</li>
