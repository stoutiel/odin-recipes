<h2>
    Oasis sought out to be a less goofy version of the Beatles. 
    Noel basically used classic blues guitar played in standard 
    rock rhythm patterns and stole lots of cool riffs from 70s bands
    like T Rex, Bowie, and obviously the Beatles.   
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use 2 Gibson or Epiphone guitars, one playing syncopated rhythm and one playing blues leads and simple arpeggios, with a marshall amp and any bass.</li>
    <li>Effect pedals are kept to a minimum, just use a Rat distortion pedal and lots of gain on the amp</li>
    <li>Keep the drums simple and use fills to mark transitions</li>
    <li>Use a major key with some "wrong" chords to make it interesting. i.e. if playing in G major, use Em and Bm like you're supposed to but also use E and B. </li>
    <li>Do not use 4 chord progressions. Use 6 or 8 chords per section.</li>
    <li>Set tempo around 90 bpm</li>
    <li>Your lyrics should be utter nonsense, just make it rhyme</li>
    <li>Typical song structure, which Noel stole from The Smith's There Is a Light (he called it the perfect pop song): <br> 
    <ul>
        <li>Intro - 12 bars of building tension to be relieved by the verse</li>
        <li>Verse</li>
        <li>Verse</li>
        <li>Bridge</li>
        <li>Chorus</li>
        <li>Verse with a solo instead of lyrics</li>
        <li>Verse</li>
        <li>Verse</li>
        <li>Bridge</li>
        <li>Chorus</li>
        <li>Outro</li>

    </ul></li>
</ol>
