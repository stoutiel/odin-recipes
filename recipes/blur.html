<h1>Blur</h1>

Blur made music intended to appeal to alternative rock fans who were put off by the drabness of grunge and shoegaze. They used dance beats, falsetto voice, angular guitars, and lyrics about daily life in England: watch telly, drink tea, do drugs, be in love, go dancing. This was Blur's formula for Britpop:

<h2>Recipe</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use a telecaster and either a jazz or precision bass.</li>
    <li>No reverb, no crazy effects, just lots of gain on the amps</li>
    <li>Drums are pretty simple and use fills to mark transitions</li>
    <li>Use a major key with some "wrong" chords to make it interesting. i.e. if playing in G major, use Em and Bm like you're supposed to but also use E and B. </li>
    <li>Set tempo around 120 bpm</li>
    <li>Typical song structure: <br> 
    <ul>
        <li>Intro - same as verse but with no lyrics</li>
        <li>Verse - talk about something and be specific</li>
        <li>Interlude - Catchy repetitive melody goes here</li>
        <li>Chrous - talk about something and be very general</li>
        <li>Interlude</li>
        <li>Verse</li>
        <li>Chorus</li>
        <li>Interlude with a solo that uses a bunch of out-of-key notes</li>
        <li>Chorus</li>
        <li>Interlude</li>

    </ul></li>
</ul>
