<h2>Blur made music intended to appeal to alternative rock fans who were put off by the drabness of grunge and shoegaze. It turned out that there was a massive market for people who liked interesting music and were also not depressed. This was Blur's formula for Britpop:</h2>
<div class="steps">
<ul>
    <li>Use a telecaster with a vox amp and either a jazz or precision bass.</li>
    <li>Guitar plays pop rock rhythms and country licks while bass does walking lines</li>
    <li>Minimal effects, just a little gain. Twangy tones.</li>
    <li>Drums beats are driving and danceable with fills to mark changes in the song</li>
    <li>Play standard rock chord progressions but throw in a few flat chords, some majors when <br> a minor is expected, use the major and minor versions of the same chord (eg D and Dm)</li>
    <li>honestly just copy Beatles progressions especially from Rubber Soul</li>
    <li>Write lyrics about life's simple pleasures with a lot of references to art and literature</li>
    <li>Set tempo around 120 bpm</li>
    <li>Typical song structure: <br> 
    <ul>
        <li>Intro </li>
        <li>Verse </li>
        <li>Interlude</li>
        <li>Chrous</li>
        <li>Interlude</li>
        <li>Verse</li>
        <li>Chorus</li>
        <li>Interlude with a solo that uses a bunch of out-of-key notes</li>
        <li>Chorus</li>
        <li>Interlude</li>

    </ul></li>

   
</ul>
